## Overview

CD-ORL addresses the challenges of coordinating sensor-actuator systems in complex robotic platforms by:

1. Incorporating subequivariant graph networks to preserve transitional symmetries and dependencies.
2. Utilizing large language models (LLMs) to extract semantic physical knowledge as priors.
3. Employing LLM-based trajectory simulation for data augmentation.

This approach significantly improves sample efficiency and control accuracy across various robotic tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cd-orl.git
   cd cd-orl
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. To use Docker, run:
   ```
   ./docker_run.sh
   ```

## Usage

1. Fine-tune the LLM for physical knowledge extraction:
   ```
   python llm_finetuning/llama_3_model.py
   ```

2. Process the raw data:
   ```
   python processed/mujoco_env.py
   ```

3. Train the CD-ORL model:
   ```
   python scripts/run_experiment.py
   ```

4. Evaluate the model:
   ```
   python scripts/stepping_task.py
   ```
